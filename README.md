# E-Commerce Project (MERN Stack)
This is a full-fledged e-commerce project built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

## Features:
- REST API for product and user management.
- Secure authentication system.
- Order processing and cart management.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup
- Initialized project and set up GitHub repository.
- Created `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- Set up a `README.md` file for documentation.

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

This milestone involves setting up the project structure, initializing the React frontend, configuring Tailwind CSS, and building a functional login page. We will create a Login.jsx component, implement API integration, and add routing using React Router. The frontend will be styled with Tailwind CSS, and the backend will handle authentication requests. After completing this milestone, the login page should be fully functional, allowing users to log in successfully.
